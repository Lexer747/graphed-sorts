# Some sorts Graphed

Currently, a small program i wrote back in 2015 which implemented as many sorts as i knew of at the time and displayed each major step on a bar graph.
Written useing visual studio so the code needs refactoring and cleaning but the program works. Also was my first real use of threading which is a laughbly bad
implementation of moving work onto another thread.

## Current Sorts:

* Intro
* Quick
* Merge
* Count
* Heap
* Radix
* Bucket
* Selection
* Insertion
* Binary Insertion
* Comb
* Shell

### Current Bad Sorts:

* Cocktail
* Bubble
* Slow
* Gnome
* Bozo
* Bogo
    
## TODO: -
    
* Refactor and clean
* Add more sorts
  * Timsort
  * more hybridsorts
